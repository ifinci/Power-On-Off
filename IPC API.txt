IPC API
-------

This is my understanding of the API. I still didn't get anything official from cpscom.com.

serial settings: baudrate - 300, no parity, 8 bits, 1 stop bit.

* - this is the attention mark, each command should start with this.
$ - this is the end of reply.

commands:
PON - set the power (relay) to ON. expected reply "PON$"
POF - set the power (relay) to OFF. Excpected reply "POF$"
?PS - ping for status. return looks like: "2.61100600000000$"
       parsing: 
        [0..2] - 2.6 - version
        [3] - 1 - Relay (power) ON. 0 if OFF.
        [4] - 1 - Opti-jumper, no clue what it is.
        [5] - 0 - power up state.
        [6] - 0 - rings to reboot.
        [7] -
